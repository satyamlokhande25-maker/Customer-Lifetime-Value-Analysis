## Project Overview

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a metric used to estimate the total value a customer brings to a business over the entire relationship. This project provides tools to preprocess customer data, perform exploratory data analysis, and predict CLV using statistical and machine learning models.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- CLV prediction using various models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Visualization of customer segments and value
- Model evaluation and selection

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/satyamlokhande25-maker/Customer-Lifetime-Value-Analysis.git
   cd Customer-Lifetime-Value-Analysis
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your customer data in the required format (CSV or Excel).
